----
edit Dec.16 2017: 
I won't continue to develop this project any longer, because I became interested in developping (rewriting) web-based PTCG simulator with Node.js.<br>
This project has almost all of functions to play game with vanilla cards, but no implimentation of moves and abilities.<br>
Those who are interested in, feel free to contact me. (twitter: @lagyu_wspk)

The final purpose of this project is the following;
1. develop an command-line based Pokemon TCG simulator to connect some AI (something like AlphaGo Zero) and find new srategy.<br>
2. develop an cross-platform GUI based online Pokemon TCG simulator and publish it to build an statistic site. (something like HSReplay: https://hsreplay.net)
