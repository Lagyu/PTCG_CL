# PTCG_CL

This is Pokemon TCG simulator with python. (under development. This once was for Command-line based but I'm now seeking for GUI-based interface.)<br>
This project is mainly for studying.<br>
Currently, the program is not useful at all.

edit on Dec. 16, 2017:<br>
I won't continue to develop this project any longer, because most of code should be rewrited with "object-oriented" style to continue developing.
This project has almost all of functions to play game with vanilla cards, but little implimentation of indivisual moves and abilities.<br>
Those who are interested in, feel free to contact me. (twitter: @lagyu_wspk)

The final purpose of this project is the following;
1. Develop an command-line based Pokemon TCG simulator to connect some AI (something like AlphaGo Zero) and find new srategies.<br>
2. Develop an cross-platform GUI based online Pokemon TCG simulator and publish it to build an statistic site. (something like HSReplay: https://hsreplay.net)

Also, this project has learning aspect for me.
